I have always wanted to explore the intersection of my passion for coding and my background in core engineering, which ultimately has led me to pursue geospatial development as a career.</p> <p>Developing solutions for real-world geospatial problems has always been a major source of inspiration for me. This has led me to develop a interest in geospatial research, which was only further augmented by my research experience during my Master's degree. Presently, I am working as a Research Associate in the Visual Computing Group of CYENS Centre of Excellence, Nicosia. I am also pursuing doctoral research at the Cyprus University of Technology.</p> <p>My work primarily focuses on developing deep neural network architectures for 3D urban scene understanding and recognition.</p> <p>Besides all the technical jargon, I am a person who enjoys my everyday evening cup of tea and in my downtime, listening to my favourite music, sketching away at a piece of paper as I see fit.</p> <p>Below, you will find some formal information on my background.

The main objective of this project was to create a web-based interactive geospatial application capable of tracking and visualising the lifelong travels of Mahatma Gandhi with as much spatiotemporal precision as possible.</p> <p>The data for the travels of Mahatma Gandhi was manually retrieved from several sources such as biographies, news articles, etc. and compiled into a dataframe. After this, the geolocation of the various locations was carried and records with erroneous coordinates were corrected. Then, the means of travel between one location to the next was determined by using a combination of network analysis and contextual editing of some travel routes. Finally, the web application was created using Folium and Leaftlet, in addition to custom HTML, CSS and JS.</p> <p>Upon completion of this project, I learned the basics of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This project also gave me valuable insights in using several open geospatial libraries in Python and the data preparation required for those libraries.

The library was chosen as the object for documentation owing to it being a landmark structure of the IIST campus. In this study, the FARO Focus S350 terrestrial laser scanner was used to conduct the LiDAR surveys. After completion of the survey, the collected point cloud data was transferred to the Remote Sensing Lab for further processing.</p> <p>During registration of the individual scans, it was observed that indoor &amp; outdoor surfaces of buildings offered plenty of easily-identifiable target points which allowed the scans to be registered manually without standard target objects. Upon further processing, the very large size of the point cloud proved to be a hindrance and hence, the point cloud was downsampled to a reasonable extent. The Potree WebGL based point cloud rendered was found to be well suited for the task of digital documentation and visualisation of large point clouds.</p>"},{"location":"projects/kpip_irrigation/","title":"Kpip irrigation","text":"Estimation of Cultivated/Cultivable (Ayacut) Area for the Kanjirappuzha Irrigation Project Technical Report <p>This project was carried out as part of an outreach programme to the Irrigation Design and Research Board (IDRB) of the Government of Kerala.

The primary mode of data acquisition was in situ surveys of individual trees and 32m x 32m forest plots using the FARO Focus S350 terrestrial laser scanner.</p> <p>In this project, a weighted random forest classifier was used to perform foliage filtration. Geometric features were calculated at different scales for each point and passed as inputs for the classifier. After foliage filtration, existing state-of-the-art methods were implemented to construct quantitative structure models (QSMs) from the foliage filtered point clouds, from which the above-ground volume of trees was accurately estimated.</p> <p>At the end of this study, in addition to meeting the objectives of the research, I had gained substantial proficiency in planning and conducting TLS surveys of forests, registration &amp; preprocessing of LiDAR data, computing normals &amp; geometric features of point clouds, point-wise classification of point clouds, etc.</p>"}]}
