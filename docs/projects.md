### [Chronological Itinerary of Mahatma Gandhi's Travels](projects/gandhi_project.md)

I worked on this project during my Master's degree, to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The main objective of this project was to create a web-based interactive geospatial application capable of tracking and visualising the lifelong travels of Mahatma Gandhi with as much spatiotemporal precision as possible.
