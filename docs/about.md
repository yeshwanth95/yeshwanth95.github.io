# About me



Apart from being a mostly self-taught programmer, I have a Master's degree in Geoinformatics from the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology and a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Anna University. I have always wanted to explore the intersection of my passion for coding and my background in core engineering, which ultimately has led me to pursue geospatial development as a career.

Developing solutions for real-world geospatial problems has always been a major source of inspiration for me. This has led me to develop a interest in geospatial research, which was only further augmented by my research experience during my Master's degree. Presently, I am working as a Research Associate in the Visual Computing Group of CYENS Centre of Excellence, Nicosia. I am also pursuing doctoral research at the Cyprus University of Technology.

My work primarily focuses on developing deep neural network architectures for 3D urban scene understanding and recognition.

Besides all the technical jargon, I am a person who enjoys my everyday evening cup of tea and in my downtime, listening to my favourite music, sketching away at a piece of paper as I see fit.

Below, you will find some formal information on my background. For more details, checkout out my full [CV](./assets/AYK_CV_Aug2024.pdf).
